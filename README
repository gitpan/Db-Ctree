This is the first BETA of Db::Ctree, a module to access Faircom's Ctree 
database from within Perl 5.

I created this module because I wanted to use Perl to generate reports from
data stored in a Ctree database.  The bulk of the code at our site is written
in C using the Faircom C library, so I need not need to create files
and resource records.  Yes, this is a quick hack.  It will improve over time
if there is interest.

It is not mean to replace Faircom's development license.  That license is
still required legally (I think... I'm not a lawyer, nor play one on TV),
morally and without a doubt documentation wise.  If you can use this 
module without that documentation, that's pretty impressive.

In order to do the port, I took the function list and parameters from the
quick reference list and converted the data types.  I needed to remove a few
functions that dealt with some file structures, but most of the routines 
are available.  I have not tested each one, but have yet to find one that
didn't work from perl.

All low level and most ISAM routines seem to work fine.  Functions that need
a C structure are not currently supported.  I'm still trying to figure out
how I want to implement them.

If you use the ISAM routines, you need to either have a C program create 
resource records so you can use OpenFileWithResource or open it with a 
parameter file.  My Method access routines uses the OpenFileWithResource
function.

If your files have DODA information stored in them (again, by a C program),
a Method is available to split a record into a hash!!

If you give this module a shot, please drop me an email so I can let you know
of new versions or just get a warm fuzzy!

I've provided two routines (with minor site customizations) ctload and ctdump
that we use quite often.
